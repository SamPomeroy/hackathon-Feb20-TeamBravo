  "body": "Building on basic prompting techniques, advanced prompt engineering enables more reliable and sophisticated interactions with LLMs.\n\n**Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting**: Encouraging the model to show its reasoning step-by-step before arriving at an answer. This significantly improves performance on math, logic, and multi-step reasoning tasks.\n\n**Few-Shot Prompting**: Providing examples of desired input-output pairs in the prompt to guide the model's behavior. Effective for formatting, style matching, and task specification.\n\n**System Prompt Design**: Crafting system-level instructions that define the model's persona, constraints, and behavioral guidelines. Critical for production applications.\n\n**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)**: Combining LLMs with external knowledge retrieval to ground responses in specific, up-to-date information. Reduces hallucination and enables domain-specific applications.\n\n**Prompt Chaining**: Breaking complex tasks into a sequence of simpler prompts, where each step's output feeds into the next. Enables more reliable multi-step workflows.\n\nFellows will implement each technique in hands-on labs during weeks 3-4 of the AISE program.",
